      <p>Temuco is the main urban center of the Ninth Region, since it is the capital of the area reminiscent of the country's AraucanÃ­a. Located in the middle of beautiful heights constituted by the hills Conun Huenu and Ã‘ielol, Temuco is an important nucleus for economic, administrative, cultural and academic activities. With a population that exceeds two hundred thousand inhabitants, the regional capital that was founded in 1881 for the purpose of containment of the indigenous people of the area, is currently one of the most important Chilean cities.</p>
